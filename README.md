## Hello!

This project consists of several basic programs to help me practice Java.

## Classes

You can find several classes, all ran from the "App" class's main method:

- `Fibonacci`: Outputs a fibonacci sequence of set length.
- `PrimeNumber`: Tests if a number is prime or not.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
